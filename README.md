In this assignment, youâ€™ll create and manipulate Pandas DataFrames to analyze school and standardized test data.

## Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

## Method
Using the starter code provided, I calculated each of the desired values to analyze the dataset. Overall, we were finding ways to compare the average scores in math and reading standardized tests across students in the specific dataset. I first got a baseline by getting the average scores over the total population, and then broke these numbers out into various categories.

At first, I compared the average scoress across the individual schools. The top 5 schools in % overall passing were within a hair's bredth of one another (roughly 90.5% overall passing to 91.3% overall passing). Similarly, the bottom 5 schools were close to one another in their % overall passing population (52.98% at the lowest, and 53.54% at the highest of these bottom 5).

When analyzing the scores for each school across grades, I did not see a significant difference among the scores for each participating grade. Each school appears to be consistent in the scores their students achieve, no matter to which grade they belong.

The real difference came when analyzing the grades achieved by students when comparing the amount of money spent per student. Students at school with a lower per student spending budget achieved higher scores than those at schools with a higher per capita budget. This goes for math tests, reading tests, and overall passing. Similarly, smaller to medium sized schools achieved higher scores than larger schools.
